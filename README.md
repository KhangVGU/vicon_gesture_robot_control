# vicon_gesture_robot_control

The control scripts are located in the folder src/youbot_vicon_control/src/hello_world.py

Currently, the control method is driving the robot with the velocities equal to the rotation angles of the gesture input device. For this project, we should map the following gestures as commands:
  - Flick Back to Front: Robot moves forward for 0.5 m
  - Flick Front to Back: Robot moves backward for 0.5 m
  - Rotate Counter-Clockwise: Robot turns left 30 degree
  - Rotate Clockwise: Robot turns right 30 degree
